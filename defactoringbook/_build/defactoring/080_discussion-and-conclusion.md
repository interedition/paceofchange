## Discussion & Conclusion

The story told by *Defactoring 'Pace of Change'* is that of
methodological data transformation made material through an exhaustive,
line-by-line, reading *and execution* of the bespoke code used in
Underwood and Sellers's historical literary analysis. *Code is the
engine of intermediate representation.* What we mean by this is that the
computational narrative told by the Pace of Change code underpinning the
publications by Underwood and Sellers is one of transformations.
Transformation of data (and metadata) into new data. Code is the
material representation, the record, the documentary residue of
methodology. But code, when executed, is also the engine of these
transformations.
