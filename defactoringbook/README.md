# Defactoring Pace of Change JupyterBook

This repository contains the sources for the [JupyterBook](https://jupyter.org/jupyter-book/intro) we created to present our methodological work on defactoring and code reviewing the academic work and scientific coding associated with Ted Underwood's and Jordan Sellers' paper ["How quickly do literary standards change?"](http://figshare.com/articles/How_Quickly_Do_Literary_Standards_Change_/1418394).

For more information visit either the actual book at [https://interedition.github.io/defactoringbook](https://interedition.github.io/defactoringbook/) or the repository at [https://github.com/interedition/paceofchange](https://github.com/interedition/paceofchange) that contains our Jupyter Notebook and the fork of Underwood's and Seller's code base that we based our work on.
