<p>According to various scholars (e.g. Burgess and Hamming 2011, and
Clement 2016) there is a dichotomy between on the one hand a ‘pure’
intellectual realm associated with scholarly writing and academic print
publication, and on the other hand the ‘material labor’ associated with
the performance of the pure intellectual realm, for example, instrument
making or programing. On closer inspection such a dichotomy turns out to
be largely artificial. For their argument Burgess, Hamming, and Clement
refer to the earlier work of Bruno Latour (1993) who casts the defining
characteristic of modernity as a process of ‘purification’ aiming to
contrast the human culture of modernity to nature. Burgess and Hamming
observe a congruent process in academia: “Within the academy we see
these processes of purification and mediation at work, producing and
maintaining the distinction between intellectual labor and material
labor, both of which are essential to multimedia production” (Burgess
and Hamming 2011:¶11). This process serves to distinguish between
scholarly and non-scholarly activities: “The distinction between
intellectual and material labor is pervasive throughout scholarly
criticism and evaluation of media forms. […] In addition, any
discussion of scholarly activities in multimedia formats are usually
elided in favor of literary texts, which can be safely analyzed using
traditional tools of critical analysis” (Burgess and Hamming 2011:¶12).
However, as Burgess and Hamming note, this distinction is based upon a
technological fallacy already pointed out by Richard Grusin in 1994.
Grusin argued that Hypertext has not changed the essential nature of
text, as writing has always already been hypertextual through the use of
indices, notes, annotations, and intertextual references. To assume that
the technology of Hypertext has revolutionarily unveiled or activated
the associative nature of text, amounts to the fallacy of ascribing the
associative agency of cognition to the technology, which however is of
course a ‘mere’ expression of that agency.</p>

<p>To assume an intellectual dichotomy between scholarly publication
resulting from writing versus code resulting from programming, is a
similar technological fallacy. To assert that scholarship is somehow
bound to print publication exclusively is a akin to the ascribing of
agency to the technology of written text, because such an understanding
of scholarship presupposes that something is scholarship because it is
in writing, that writing makes it scholarship. But obviously publication
is a function of scholarship and scholarship is not a function of
publication, because scholarship does not arise from publication but is
‘merely’ expressed through it.</p>

<p>If scholarship expresses anything through publication it is argument,
which is, much more than writing, an essential property of scholarship.
But in essence it does not matter how, or by which form, the argument is
made—whether it is made through numbers, pictures, symbols, words, or
objects. Those are all technologies that enable us to shape and express
an argument. This is not to say that technologies are mere inert and
neutral epistemological tools, different technologies shape and affect
argument in different ways. Technological choices do matter, and
different technologies can enrich scholarly argument. Producing an
argument requires some expressive technology, and the knowledge and
ability to wield that technology effectively, which in the case of
writing is called ‘literacy’. As Alan Kay (1993) observed, literacy is
not just gaining a fluency in technical skills of reading and writing.
It also requires a “fluency in higher level ideas and concepts and how
these can be combined” (Kay 1993:83). This fluency is both structural
and semantic. In the case of writing as technology it is for instance
about sentence structure, semantic cohesion between sentences, and about
how to express larger ideas by connecting paragraphs and documents.
These elements of literacy translate to the realm of coding and
computing (Vee 2013) where fluency is about the syntax of statements and
how to express concepts for instance as object classes, methods and
functions that call upon other programs and data structures to control
the flow of computation. Text and writing may still be the most
celebrated semiotic technologies to express an argument, but computer
code understood as ‘just another’ literacy (cf. Knuth 1984, Kittler
1993, Vee 2013) means it can thus equally be a medium of scholarly
argument. We start from this assertion that coding and code—as the
source code of computer programs that is readable to humans and which
drives the performative nature of software (Ford 2015, Hiller
2015)—can be inherent parts of scholarship or even scholarship by
itself. That is: we assert that code can be scholarly, that coding can
be scholarship, and that there is little difference between the
authorship of code or text (Van Zundert 2016).</p>

<p>There are two compelling reasons why code should be of interest to
scholars. Much has been written about the dramatic increase of software,
code, and digital objects in society and culture over the last decades
often with a lamenting or dystopian view (Morozov 2013, Bostrom 2016).
But aside from doomsday prognostications there is ample evidence that
society and its artifacts are increasingly also made up of a ‘digital
fabric’ (Jones 2014, Berry 2014, Manovich 2013). This means that the
object of study of humanities scholars is also changing—literature,
texts, movies, games, music increasingly exist as digital data created
through software (and thus code). This different fabric is also
branching off cultural objects with different and new properties, for
instance in the case of electronic literature and storytelling in
general (Murray 2016). It is thus crucial for scholars studying these
new forms of humanistic artifacts to have an understanding of how to
read code and understand the computational processes it represents.
Furthermore, as code and software are increasingly part of the
technologies that humanities scholars employ to examine their
sources—examples of this abound (e.g. Van Dalen &amp; Van Zundert 2007;
Tangherlini 2012; Piper 2015; Kestemont, Moens, and Deploige 2015; etc.)
understanding the workings of code is therefore becoming a prerequisite
for a solid methodological footing in the humanities.</p>

<p>Over the last decade code and its creation have become substantial parts
of the objects and methods of study within the humanities (cf. for
instance Underwood and Sellers 2015; Ramsay 2011). Coding and code now
represent the material <em>and</em> intellectual labour of scholarship, and as
such constitutes an important part of scholarly epistemology.
Conventional epistemological instruments—such as historiography, close
reading, deconstruction and hermeneutics—that constitute large or
important parts of analysis have the property by which their expressions
<em>as writing</em> are also their scholarly publications. In effect most
scholarly articles are de facto inscriptions of such epistemological
tools: they inscribe the argument a humanist shaped using this
particular abductive style of reasoning, which is quite indigenous to
the humanities. Afterwards these inscriptions are offered to other
scholars for scrutiny and evaluation, making the research accountable
through peer review. Confusingly, in the humanities analysis and
inscription are often one and the same: the argument is shaped by
creating text, and the reporting is a polished version of the argument
inscribed as text. This is not to say there is not a significant amount
of writing and intellectual/material labor that doesn’t make the “final
cut” so to speak, but rather we want to highlight the material
expression of this labor is of the same kind.</p>

<p>As an epistemological instrument, code has the interesting property of
representing both the intellectual and material labor of scholarly
argument in computational research. Code affords method not as a
prosaic, descriptive abstraction, but as the actual, executable
inscription of methodology. However, the code underpinning the
methodological elements of the discourse are themselves not presented as
elements in the discourse. Their status is akin to how data and facts
are colloquially perceived, as givens, objective and neutral pieces of
information or observable objects. But like data (Gitelman 2013) and
facts (Betti 2015), code is unlikely to be ever ‘clean’, ‘unbiased’, or
‘neutral’ (cf. also Berry 2014). Code is the result of a particular
literacy (cf. for instance Knuth 1984, Kittler 1993, Vee 2013) that
encompasses the skills to read and write code, create and relate larger
code constructs and code objects and to express concepts, ideas, and
argument. And like text code can be wielded to gain a certain intended
effect or have unintended side effects (cf. e.g. McPherson 2012). In
other words: code has rhetorics. Therefore, what Joanna Drucker (2011)
holds about data—that rather than ‘given’ data should be called
‘capta’, i.e. ‘that which was taken’—is the more true for code: it is
a symbolic system with its own rhetoric and cultural embeddedness
(Marino 2006) and latent agency (Van Zundert 2016). Thus, rather than
accepting code and its workings as an unproblematic expression of a
mathematically neutral or abstract mechanism, it should be regarded as a
first-order part of a discourse that should be under peer scrutiny as a
whole. If code and coding are substantial constituting parts of the
argument, then it would be quite extraordinary to not subject these to
the same forms of scrutiny and accountability. Yet code hardly ever is
regarded as scholarly output, and if it is published at all it is seldom
or never evaluated (cf. Schreibman, Mandell, and Olsen 2011).</p>

<p>However, the acceptance of code as another form of scholarly argument
presents problems to the current scholarly process of evaluation because
of a lack of well-developed methods for reading, reviewing, and
critiquing scholarly code. Digital humanities as a site of production of
non-conventional research outputs—digital editions, web-based
publications, new analytical methods, and computational tools for
instance—has spurred the debate on evaluative practices in the
humanities, exactly because practitioners of digital scholarship
acknowledge that much of the relevant scholarship is not expressed in
the form of traditional scholarly output. Yet the focus of review
generally remains on “the fiction of ‘final outputs’ in digital
scholarship” (Nowviskie 2011), on old form peer review (Antonijevic
2016), and on approximating equivalencies of digital content and
traditional print publication (Presner 2012). Discussions around the
evaluation of digital scholarship have thus “tended to focus primarily
on establishing digital work as equivalent to print publications to make
it count instead of considering how digital scholarship might transform
knowledge practices” (Purdy and Walker 2010:178; Anderson and McPherson,
2011). As a reaction, digital scholars have stressed how peer review of
digital scholarship should foremost consider how digital scholarship is
different from conventional scholarship. They argue that review should
be focussed on the process of developing, building, and knowledge
creation (Nowviskie 2011), on the contrast and overlap between the
representationality of conventional scholarship and the strong
performative aspects of digital scholarship (Burgess and Hamming 2011),
and on the specific medium of digital scholarship (Rockwell 2011).</p>

<p>Where the debate on peer review of digital output in digital scholarship
might have propelled a discourse on reading code and code literacy as an
epistemological technology of scholarship it has rather been geared to
high level evaluation, concentrating for instance on the issue how
digital scholarship could be reviewed in the context of promotion and
tenure track evaluations. Very little has been proposed as to concrete
techniques and methods for the practical review of program code.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>
Existing guidance pertains to digital objects such as digital editions
(Sahle and Vogler 2014) or to code as cultural artefact (Marino 2006),
but no substantial work has been put forward on how to read or review
<em>scholarly</em> code. We are left with the rather general statement that
“traditional humanities standards need to be part of the mix, [but]
the domain is too different for them to be applied without considerable
adaptation” (Smithies 2012), and the often echoed contention that
digital artefacts should be evaluated–<em>in silico</em>–as they are and not
as to how they manifest in conventional publications. The latter
argument probably most succinctly put by Geoffrey Rockwell (2011):
“While such narratives are useful to evaluators […] they should
never be a substitute for review of the work in the form it was produced
in.”</p>
